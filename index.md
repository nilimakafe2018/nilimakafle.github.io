# Hi, I'm Nilima Kafle 👋

I am a passionate Software Developer with 3+ years of experience building data-driven web applications and full-stack solutions. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, user-friendly systems using JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, Python, and SQL. I also have experience as a Data Analyst, where I extracted data using SQL, analyzed trends, and presented insights to stakeholders and faculty. I have worked on academic and professional projects involving dashboards, database integration, and reporting, and I am always excited to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful technology solutions.
